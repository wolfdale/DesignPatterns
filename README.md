# DesignPatterns
Exploring Design Patterns with Java

<b>Factory Method:</b> Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

<b>Abstract Factory:</b> Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

AbstractFactory pattern uses composition to delegate responsibility of creating object to another class while Factory method pattern uses inheritance and relies on derived class or sub class to create object
